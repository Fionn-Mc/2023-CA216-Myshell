Shell:
    This is a typed interface with which you can interface with a computer through commands.

    (to open
        -open the terminal on linux
        -navigate to te repository that myshell is stored
        -type make into the command line
        -type "./myshell" to run the program
    )




Commands:

-clr:
    clears the interface of previously generated or typed text

-dir:
    lists the files in the current folder

-quit:
    ends the program

-cd (directory):
    changes the current workind directory or folder to the specified directory

-environ:
    lists all of the environment strings

-echo:
    repeats input given on command line back onto command line

-pause:
    pauses the program until enter is pressed




Environment Concepts:

-Environment Variables: A set of key-value pairs that are used to store information about the environment of the shell. Used to pass information between processes and to configure the behavior of the shell.

-Command Line Arguments: arguments passed to a shell program when it is executed. Used to specify the behavior of the program or to provide input to the program.

-Standard Input, Output, and Error: The streams of data used to communicate with the user or with other processes. In C, these streams are represented by the file descriptors stdin, stdout, and stderr, respectively.

-Process Environment: A set of variables and data structures used to manage the execution of a program. It includes information about the current working directory, the process ID, and other important information.

-Signal Handling: A way for the operating system to communicate with a process. They can be used to indicate that an error has occurred, or to request that the process terminate.




I/O Redirection:

-Allows the user to control where the input and output of a command is sent.

-I/O redirection is done using special characters, such as <, >, and >>, which are called input/output redirection operators.

-The < operator is used to direct input from a file into a program.

-The > operator is used to redirect output to a file.

-The >> operator is used to append output to a file.

-It is possible to use input and output redirection on the same program.
